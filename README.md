Currently, http://52.14.40.39:8080/VaganteScholars/monsters has basic content

The goal of this website will to create a space where players of the video game Vagante can find and discuss information regarding the game. It will provide a user login system that allows for messaging other users, following users and pages, and other common social media systems.

The informational part of the website will feature a dynamically linked database, allowing for cascading changes throughout the website from a single change.

Current Planned Plugins:

    Bootstrap
    jQuery
    jQuery Datatables

Current planned technologies:

    Google reCaptcha
    Google 2-step authentication
    Maybe something with Twitch.tv api to bring in direct live streams of the game
    Probably more?
